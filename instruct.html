                <em>The selector:</em> On the right hand side of the screen just below the navigation within the homepage is a drop-down menu. Use this to go through all of your cats and simply click on the cat you would like to render onto the page.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <em>Current section:</em> All of your cats have personalized data - image, name, and value 'clicks' - which represents how many times you have clicked on that specific cat. Click on the current image of any cat in your cat selector and see how it works!
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <em>Admin section:</em> All right lets get to the good stuff hah? To display the admin section, you must click on the admin button twice. Afterwards, toggling display only requires one click. Inside of the admin display you are able to change the current cat data, delete the current cat, add a new cat, and reset all cat data.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <em>Change data:</em> This section allows you to change the name, image, or clicks of the current cat.
                <br>
                <ul class="iList">
                    <li>Name - Enter new name -> Activate 'name' button</li>
                    <li>Image - Enter image url (parentDirectory/imageName.imageType) -> Activate 'image url' button</li>
                    <li>Clicks - Enter clicks (number) -> Activate 'clicks' button</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <em>Delete current:</em> The delete button will delete the cat and all of it's data that is selected within your cat selector/rendered onto screen.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <em>Add cat:</em> The add button requires two values - name and image URL. Use the same format for the image URL as used in the change data section.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <em>Reset button:</em> This button does as it reads, resets all of your cats and all of their data back to their defaults.
            </p>
