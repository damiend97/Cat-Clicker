This is a really useless app that was built to test my own skills with custom MVC's (model view controller)

## What is MVC?
A MVC (model view controller) seperates software components into three sections.
## Model 
The data.
## View
The user interface.
## Controller
The communicator. Tells the data and view what to do based on user input.
